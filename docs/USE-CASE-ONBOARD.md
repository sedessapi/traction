# Use Case: Tenant Onboarding 
The following videos demonstrate the self-serve onboarding process for a Traction Tenant using the Tenant UI interface.

3 "personas" are demonstrated in these demos

1. A prospective Tenant. A user that wishes to request a Tenant be created for their use. This user makes use of publicly accessible pages on the Tenant UI without authenticating.
2. A Tenant. Once the Tenant has been created, the user can use the Tenant UI as a representative of that Tenant.
3. An Innkeeper user. One of the operational or adminsitrative team members that can control access to the Traction system

### Reservation
A user wishing to create a Tenant makes a Reservation outlining their request and the Innkeeper approves it. The user can then create the Tenant and obtain the credentials.

### Deny Reservation
An Innkeeper can reject a Reservation and inform the person who made the reservation.

### Make Teanant an Issuer
Once the Tenant has accessed the system, they can make their Tenant an Issuer by connecting to an Endorser and Registering a Public DID
